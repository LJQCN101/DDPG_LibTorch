# DDPG_LibTorch
An implementation of the DDPG Algorithm in LibTorch 1.6

[LibTorch](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html)

As environment I used OpenAi-Gym

[C++ OpenAi-Gym API](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api)

and 

[boost](https://www.boost.org/)

I could successfully solve the Pendulum environment.
